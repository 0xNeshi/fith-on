## Story time

It wasn't too hard for me to track all my weights/percentages using a simple notepad, but once my girlfriend got interested in following the same program and we entered a sort of personal trainer-trainee dynamic, it got a bit more difficult to manage both her and my weights. To make matters worse, her phone that contained her weight records got reset with all her notes gone. This was rather demotivating for her because she was diligent in her tracking habits, and it meant she had no point of reference when challenging herself, no record of prior personal bests in either weight, sets or reps.

Now, for some time prior to this, I was looking for a project to test and hone my React skills, but it wasn't high on my list of priorities until this happened. This pushed me to commit myself to creating the app you're looking at right now. I couldn't allow the thing that happened to my girlfriend to happen to either of us ever again, so I took a long walk and decided on the app I wanted to build.

FithOn is the product of hard work, sweat and back pain. Since I created it for myself and for my girlfriend, you can be sure that I payed a lot of attention to optimizing it to the extreme. And related to the previous point, living in a country with poor internet provider services, I went above and beyond in optimizing network usage.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
